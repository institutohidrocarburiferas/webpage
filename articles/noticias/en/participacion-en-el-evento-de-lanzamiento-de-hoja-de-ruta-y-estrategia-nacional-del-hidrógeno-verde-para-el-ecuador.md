The Director of the Hydrocarbon Research Institute of the Central University of Ecuador, PhD Rony Parra and the Dean of FIGEMPA, Mgtr. Gustavo Pinto Arteaga participated in the academic panel on the role of academia and research centers in the sustainable development of green hydrogen, which took place on July 17 of this year.

During the launch event, the National Green Hydrogen Roadmap and Strategy for Ecuador was announced. Both initiatives strengthen the Just Energy Transition process and contribute to the reduction of GHG emissions. The term “green hydrogen”, H2V, refers to hydrogen that is obtained without causing polluting emissions and both the Roadmap and the National Green Hydrogen Strategy seek to boost available renewable energy resources.

Ecuador is executing several projects and strategies to achieve the NDC (Nationally Determined Contributions) commitment, reducing emissions between 20 - 25% by 2025.
