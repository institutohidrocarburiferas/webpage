On September 13 and 14 in the province of Napo, researchers from the Hydrocarbon Research Institute of the Central University of Ecuador held meetings with representatives of the sectoral governments of the province, the Provincial GAD Napo and the municipal GADs of Tena and Carlos Julio Arosemena Tola.

The purpose of these meetings was to generate alliances for the development of research projects on issues of carbon neutrality, soil quality monitoring, water and deforestation. Currently, a research project in the Oglán Alto Protective Forest is about to be completed.

A little over a year ago, the “ANZU Bioindicator Monitoring System” was developed, a monitoring system based on data science to identify changes in ecosystems and use specific bioindicators to monitor ecosystem impact in the Amazon.

Projects like these are proposed by researchers and teachers of the Hydrocarbon Research Institute and, through meetings with authorities and representatives, they seek to create and strengthen alliances, as well as have the cooperation of communities to proceed with field investigations.
