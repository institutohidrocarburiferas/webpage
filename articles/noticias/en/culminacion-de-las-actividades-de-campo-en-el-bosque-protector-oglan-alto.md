Before ending the stage of activities in the Oglán Alto Protective Forest, a field trip was carried out in which information was collected in situ from the third study plot to continue with the development of the research project.

Subsequently, plant species that were previously collected and processed are identified and, based on this identification, the inventory of information on the soil, roots, standing vegetation and necromancers was concluded.

Based on all the field information, investigations to determine the carbon capture capacity will continue at the facilities and at the Hydrocarbon Research Institute, FIGEMPA and the Faculty of Biological Sciences of the Central University of Ecuador.
